Here’s a professional, attractive, and well-structured **README.md** draft for your **Visitor Counter** repository:

---

# 🚀 Visitor Counter

A simple yet powerful **IoT-based visitor counter system** built with **Arduino** and **IR sensors**, designed to automatically count the number of people entering or exiting a room, hall, or building. This project is ideal for smart home automation, classrooms, libraries, offices, or any place where monitoring foot traffic is important.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Accurate Counting** – Counts both entry and exit.
* ✅ **Real-Time Updates** – Instantly displays the current visitor count.
* ✅ **LCD Display** – Shows live data for easy monitoring.
* ✅ **Compact & Efficient** – Uses simple IR sensor and Arduino setup.
* ✅ **Scalable** – Can be expanded with IoT (ESP8266/ESP32 + Firebase/MQTT).

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

* Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega
* 2 × IR Sensors (Entry & Exit detection)
* 16x2 LCD Display (with or without I2C)
* Jumper wires & breadboard
* Power supply (5V USB/Adapter)

---

## 📦 Software Requirements

* Arduino IDE
* Required Libraries:

  * `LiquidCrystal` (for LCD display)
  * `Wire.h` (if using I2C module)

## ⚡ Circuit Diagram

👉 *(Add your circuit image here for better understanding)*

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/duttasunanda/Visitor_counter.git
   ```

2. Open the `.ino` file in **Arduino IDE**.

3. Connect your Arduino board and select the correct **COM port**.

4. Install required libraries (if not already installed).

5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

6. Power up the circuit and start monitoring visitor counts in real time.

---

## 📊 Working Principle

1. When a person crosses the **entry sensor**, the count **increases by 1**.
2. When a person crosses the **exit sensor**, the count **decreases by 1**.
3. The **LCD display** shows the current total number of visitors inside.

## 📸 Demo

👉 *(Add project images or a GIF/video here to showcase working model)*

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* Integration with **Blynk / Firebase / MQTT** for remote monitoring.
* Automatic control of **lights/fans/AC** based on visitor count.
* Web dashboard or mobile app integration.

Would you like me to also design a **repository banner image (professional cover for GitHub repo)** that will make it look even more attractive?
